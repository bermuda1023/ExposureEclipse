"""Local sustained wind inside a county, and the share of the county in each band.

The impact list used to stamp a county with the storm's peak intensity
whenever the 64 kt field reached the county centroid. That labels Miami-Dade
as a major hurricane when only a corner of the county is in the tropical-storm
skirt. This module estimates the wind at a point from Vmax, Rmax and the
directional R64, then rolls sample points up into area fractions.

Bands match the Saffir-Simpson toggles the underwriter already edits:

  -1  clear     wind < 34 kt   (not in the storm)
   0  TS        34–63 kt
   1..5         Cat 1–5

Loss is the sum across bands of (county TIV × area fraction × that band's
damage ratio). The instantaneous eye is calm, but the loss uses the peak
the point actually felt: Vmax if the eyewall crossed it (closest approach
inside Rmax), otherwise the profile at that distance, pinned so V(R64) = 64 kt.
