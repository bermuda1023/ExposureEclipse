"""Exposed TIV inside a fire polygon, rolled up by client.

The real answer needs location-level exposure (lat/lon per insured location).
The v1 data plane is county-aggregated, so we SYNTHESIZE plausible locations:
each in-portfolio county's TIV is scattered as K deterministic points within
that county, tagged by client (cedent). Point-in-polygon then rolls TIV up by
client for any fire polygon — official WFIGS perimeter or our heat-derived
shape.

This is clearly flagged ``synthetic`` on the wire. When real individual-
location data is loaded, replace ``_load_locations()`` with that source and the
point-in-polygon rollup below is unchanged.
