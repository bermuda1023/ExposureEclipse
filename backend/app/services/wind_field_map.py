"""Interpolated surface-wind field for a live-storm bbox.

Blends NDBC buoy + a spatially-uniform sample of NWS land-station reports into
a smoothed inverse-distance-weighted (IDW) wind-speed grid.

The point of doing this in-house instead of just plotting the raw obs is that
NOAA's networks are wildly non-uniform (Texas has ~10× the mesonet density of
Louisiana), individual stations go dead or return stuck-at-zero readings, and
observation times drift. Rendering the raw markers implies precision the data
doesn't have. Smoothing + cleaning produces a fair "current wind footprint"
map the underwriter can actually read.

Cleaning rules, in order:
1. Drop obs older than ``MAX_AGE_HOURS``.
2. Drop obs whose wind_kt is None.
3. Kill suspicious zeros: 0 kt readings whose local (~1.5°) neighborhood
   median is above ``LOCAL_KILL_MEDIAN_KT`` are treated as dead sensors and
   removed rather than dragging the IDW mean toward zero.

Interpolation:
- Adaptive grid step by bbox span (see ``_adaptive_step``).
- IDW power = 2.0, soft influence radius ``IDW_RADIUS_DEG`` in degrees.
- Cells with no obs inside the radius are omitted — the renderer paints
  "no data" as a gap instead of extrapolating.

    station_id)`` at the aircraft's measured position. ``centers`` is
    ``(iso_time, lat, lon)`` for the storm center: the recent observed
    fixes (the live track's back-projection is NHC's motion vector) plus
    the latest official forecast, which says where the center is after
    the current fix.

    What this is: storm-relative persistence. A sample taken in the
    eyewall is slid by the same displacement as the center, so it stays
    in the eyewall instead of being left in the wake. The wind vector is
    not rotated — over a few hours the translation is the first-order
    correction, and a bad rotation is worse than none.

    What this is not: a forecast. Speeds stay the measured SFMR / 0.8×
    flight-level values. Samples farther than ``CORE_RADIUS_NM`` from
    the center at observation time are the environment (the ferry), not
    the vortex, and are not slid. Anything older than
    ``ADVECT_MAX_AGE_H`` is dropped. If the center can't be placed at
    both times, only a sample younger than ``FRESH_KEEP_H`` is kept, and
    it stays where it was measured.

    Weight is ``exp(-age / AGE_TAU_H)`` so a hours-old pass cannot
    outvote a buoy that just reported.
