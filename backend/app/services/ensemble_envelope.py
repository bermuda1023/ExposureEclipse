"""Ensemble-consensus envelope from a set of model tracks.

For a spaghetti plot, one useful summary geometry is the "consensus cone":
the polygon that bounds the ensemble members' projected positions at each
lead time. Where models agree, the polygon is narrow; where they disagree,
it fans out.

We build it as a swept envelope: sample the ensemble positions at each
standard NHC lead time (0, 12, 24, 36, 48, 72, 96, 120, 144, 168 h),
convex-hull the members at that lead time, then concatenate the hulls into
one closed polygon. This is a rougher approximation than NHC's cone (which
uses climatological forecast-error radii), but it is entirely data-driven
and updates on every model cycle.

Stdlib-only (numpy is not a prod dep here — see CLAUDE.md).
