"""Ensemble-derived risk aggregates for one live storm.

Two aggregates over the a-deck's ensemble members (GEFS + ECMWF-ENS + AI):

**Strike probability by coastal county** — for each county centroid, the
fraction of ensemble members whose track passes within a threshold distance
(default 60 nm, roughly the operational R64 envelope of a mature hurricane).
This is the pre-loss underwriting signal an insurer actually acts on: not
"where is the mean track" but "how many independent models put damaging
wind at this county". A single deterministic model can be wildly wrong;
20+ agreeing members is an operational commitment.

**Intensity spread** — per lead-time min / mean / max wind kt across
ensemble members. Tight spread at T+72 = models agree on strength;
wide spread = one of the ensembles is landing a Cat 4 while another
lands a TS, and the pricing spread on any exposed portfolio is enormous.
