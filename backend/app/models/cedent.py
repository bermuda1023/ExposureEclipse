"""Cedent / ProgrammeChain / Programme model.

Replaces the flat `DatasetRegistry` row as the primary navigation entity.

Hierarchy
─────────
  Cedent (Farmers Group)
  └── ProgrammeChain  "BDA · Farmers Nationwide WS"   ← unit of YoY comparison
      ├── Programme 2027  (programmeId=P-..)  → EDMRef → SQL pointer
      ├── Programme 2026                     → auto-prior in this chain
      └── …

Why a chain?
  In reinsurance, the same "deal slot" renews year over year with a fresh
  programmeId — but is conceptually the same programme. YoY comparisons run
  within a chain. Each office writes its own chain; one cedent can have many
  chains (different perils, different territories, different offices).

EDMRef
  The SQL pointer that used to live on `DatasetRegistry`. A programme has
  exactly one EDM; two programmes (e.g. different years in a chain) may
  reference the same EDM if appropriate, but typically each year has its own
  data cut.
