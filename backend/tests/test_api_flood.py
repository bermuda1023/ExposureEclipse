"""Live flood overlay — endpoint + service tests.

Every test drives a fixture rather than the network. That is not just for
determinism: on a quiet day the live feed carries no moderate-or-worse
flooding at all (a probe on 2026-08-08 found 406 gauges with a single `action`
and zero minor/moderate/major), so the severity paths simply cannot be
exercised against production data.
